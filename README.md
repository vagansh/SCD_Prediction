# SCD_Prediction-

The project talks about early detection of Dementia risk by predicting Subjective Cognitive Decline which is shown to indicate objective cognitive decline in the future. 

SCD is predicted in an imbalanced dataset (10.8% cases). The data are obtained from the BRFSS CDC annual survey and processed for the final analysis.
