# SCD_Prediction-

The project talks about early detection of Dementia risk by predicting Subjective Cognitive Decline which is shown to indicate objective cognitive decline in the future. 

SCD is predicted in an imbalanced dataset (10.8% cases). The data are obtained from the BRFSS CDC annual survey and processed for the final analysis.

Abstract
Dementia is a growing public health and health-care problem. Given there is no cure for dementia, its early detection is critical. This would help in introducing rehabilitation and interventions earlier in the disease trajectory, potentially slowing down the cognitive decline. Subjective Cognitive Decline (SCD) indicative of memory loss/confusion is considered among the earliest symptomatic indicators of dementia, preceding Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Therefore, its prediction is relevant for early detection of dementia. Moreover, SCD prediction is under-explored and not many insights currently exist. In this work, we model SCD risk on real-world sparse and imbalanced data using Ensemble models. Two techniques for handling imbalanced learning are compared: Data Resampling Methods and Cost-Sensitive Training. AdaBoost classifier based on hybrid data obtained from Edited Nearest Neighbor (under-sampling) and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique - Numerical and Categorical (over-sampling) is su- perior in predicting SCD. For the final model based on this combination, the Sensitivity is increased from 3% in the imbalanced data to 58%, without much loss in Specificity (70%). The work is novel because it focuses on pre-MCI prediction while presenting and comparing techniques to handle the inherent imbalanced distribution in the data.
