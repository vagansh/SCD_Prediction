In this section, Cost Sensitive Training is illustrated. Two algorithms are used: 

1. AdaCost Classifier
2. Cost Sensitive Bagging Classifier


In the Adacost Classifier, the overally False Positive and False Negative Costs are provided. Whereas in the Cost Sensitive Bagging Classifier, each 
instance has an associated False Positive and False Negative Cost. Because this requires expert opinion, in our experiment, we have chosen constant
False Positive and False Negative Costs with each instance.
